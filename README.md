#Installation#
Drop the theme directory into your `user/themes` directory and activate it via the admin.

You'll also need the [cwm_companion](http://github.com/chrismeller/cwm_companion) plugin for everything to work, since themes cannot hook all the actions needed (yet!). Just drop it in `user/plugins` and activate it before you activate the theme.

##Navigation Block##
The navigation block can hold any block contents. For a normal navigation menu of pages I recommend the [pagemenu](http://habariproject.org/dist/plugins/pagemenu/) plugin.
